	<p>I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Only you could make those words cute.</p>
	<p>I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Makes me a â€¦ scientist. This man is a knight in shining armor. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
	<p>I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
	<p>I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>
