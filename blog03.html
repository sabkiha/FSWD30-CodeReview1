	<p>Really? Did nothing cancel? I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast.</p>
	<p>That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' I'm a monster. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>
	<p>First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Army had half a day. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Army had half a day. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</p>
	<p>We just call it a sausage. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians.</p>
